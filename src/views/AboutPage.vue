        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <br />
        <p class="mission-text" data-aos="fade" data-aos-duration="2500">
          UWPath started with a bold idea. Every term, students have to plan out
          their courses in order to make sure they graduate with all their
          major, minor and specialization requirements. What if there's a
          website that allows you to plan your degree accordingly - just like
          how you plan your class schedule every term? And voila, that's how
          UWPath started! The project started with two friends who met on their
          first co-op and the team has grown into 5 people since then!

            UWPath is a degree planning website built for UWaterloo students.
            You can plan your courses in our degree planner, where we verify
            prerequisites, corequisites, antirequisites and degree fulfillment
            on your behalf.
            <br /><br />
            Want to take a specific degree with a minor and a specialization? We
            provide automated software that shows you what courses you need to
            take for each part of your degree. See our checklist to verify you
            meet the degree requirements.

              Adrian is currently in his 3rd year at Waterloo. As a computer
              science student working towards several minors and options (CO
              minor and AI option), Adrian found it strange that there was no
              tool to help manage your schedule and meet all the different
              requirements. After experimenting with several ideas on his own,
              Adrian joined UWPath to help bring their plan to life.
              <br /><br />
              Adrian has also been spotted running around campus hunting for
              zombies in his free time.
